# Butterfly News

Ten weeks into DevAcademy the cohort was learning how to make use of external APIs with HTTP requests and server proxy routes. For this week's group project, I led a group of five students to make 'Butterfly News', a time-traveling news website. Most importantly, this project taught me to manage teamwork and organisation in a group. We made use of the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis) to get news stories from any date the user 'traveled to' and display them to the user. We also allowed the user to input a way they would change the past. Following this we'd 'return them to the present', calling Google's [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) to make up a funny story about how the Butterfly Effect would had changed the present, displaying this as it's own news story among real stories The New York Times had published in the past week.

Please note: This is a publicly visible copy of the repository, visible on my own profile. This was a collaborative project done with four others on a private repository.
